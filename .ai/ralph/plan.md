## Goal
Add TodoWrite protocol to ralph.md for breaking down SPEC tasks into trackable sub-steps during implementation.

## Files
- templates/.claude/ralph.md - add new "Sub-Task Tracking Protocol" section

## Content to Add
A new section that documents:
1. When to use TodoWrite (complex tasks with multiple steps)
2. Example TodoWrite call with proper structure (content, activeForm, status)
3. Workflow for tracking sub-tasks during implementation
4. How sub-tasks relate to SPEC tasks (sub-tasks are granular steps)
5. When to skip sub-task tracking (simple, single-action tasks)

## Exit Criteria
- New section explains when and how to use TodoWrite
- Includes example TodoWrite call with proper structure
- Documents workflow for tracking sub-tasks during implementation
- Section fits logically within ralph.md structure (after Code Review Protocol)
- Changes committed
