# Ralph Memory Index

Commit-anchored memory log. Each entry summarizes one completed task.

**Format:** One entry per commit, keyed by SHA (5-7 lines max)

**Rules:**
- Only append after successful commits
- Keep summaries concise
- List actual files changed, not planned files
- Include test count if tests were written
- "next:" hints at logical follow-up task
